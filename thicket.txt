Deep in his thicket
of the lost and broken wisdom,
I ask for a small bowl of water -
After all, may I not also be a soldier?

He looks upon me fondly,
Finding laughter among the richly
And coated, too, intempted, a sorrow
Like the bird deep, darkly, in flesh
Historic and all rageful,
neater, then, than ten-thousand faces
A 'nary to ten-topful trenchant fullness.
