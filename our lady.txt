Our lady above,
Shine upon us the glory of childbirth,
And with it an envy of the cruxed interior.

Lento schlager Emporten ringkohln,
The lilting sounds of a distant father,
Help us to know thy rhymeful wording,
That the one opposed will soon know his folly.

In deepened rifts time's lilting amber,
Remembered only by those who follow.
In-flo'd the regal mince'd enforcers,
trying untold all seven locks.
